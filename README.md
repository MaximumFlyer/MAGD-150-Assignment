Hello, my name is Max. I dream of being a game designer, so I took MAGD 150 to help get into it more. I found this class to be quite helpful and really helped introduced me into Java. I have listed below five examples of what I consider my "personal best work" of all the assignments I have completed over the course of this semester.

**A brief description of each project, linked below.**

Lab 4, Dynamism: A ocean setting that uses while loops and includes features like summoning bubbles with key presses and changing the time of day with a click of the mouse.
Lab 5, Intersections: a TV that can be turned on and off with special button commands. Features a little bouncy ball as well.
Lab 6, Organazation: Implementing classes, it mainly displays two bouncy balls that make up lines to act like some cool looking screensaver.
Lab 8, Text: Utilizing texts and the ability to save PDFs, showing off a little movie posters that parodies "Alien"
Lab 9, Image/Sound/Video: A simple project that displays a movie, a picture, and sound effects like some kind of home movie.
